### There are two types of accounts, recruiter and regular. 

After a log-in, the system will display two parts, one is the recommendations of connections to some people in the same organization or company and some 2nd connections. The second part is to display the most recent 5 job ads shared by the account holder’s connected people. 

### Below the two parts, define a menu to allow the user to use the following features 

•	See connected people and select a people to see her/his profile and connected people. 

•	Send a request to create a connection with someone. After the request is approved by the other side, the connection is built.

•	Share a job ad so the connected people can see it. 

•	A recruiter account can create and post a job ads, and then the ads are immediately seen by all of the recruiter’s connected people. 

•	Design a method to allow a user to receive a notification of a request of creating connection. The user can either approve the request or deny the request.
